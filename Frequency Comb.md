An optical comb is an evenly spaced spectrum in frequency space, similar to a Dirac comb. This is usually created using laser light which is split into light packets, which approximates a Dirac comb, creating a frequency comb as expected (FT of Dirac comb is Dirac comb). The method of generating varies,
